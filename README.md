# letsvote
This is a freecodecamp fullstack project. Detailed requirements see: https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-voting-app.

This implemented all the user stories. This can be further improved:

1) Only logged in user can vote, and each user can only vote once in a given poll
2) More smooth UIs, esp the index file showing All polls and My polls
3) On All polls/My polls, change search box from enter to search to real time as one types - tried to do this using keyup to track search input box, but seems to generate a lot of actions
4) When openning each poll, add more graphic types (current only bar chart)
5) Mobile enable (d3 charts dont seem to appear using iphone)

Then this will be a useful app. For now, just an exercise for learning.
